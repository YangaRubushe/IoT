    <h1></h1>
    <p>Assuming that you all know about the Internet of Things now, what it is, how it works
        and why it is important in our lives. So let me jump to the point which I wanted to
        address. We as South Africans we are facing a crisis which is crime. I address my two ideas: </p>

    <h1>Explanation</h1>

            <img src="images/sensor.jpg">
            <h3>Sensor</h3>
            <p>  In terms of house robbers and cars, it's really hard to accept that you have lost 
                something that you worked hard for years to get and it is taken from you easily. So 
                the idea that I have in mind to stop this crisis is the sensor that can sense the doors
                and windows when they get broken or are opened after a certain time, which will report to
                the owner of the house or a car via an app which will notify the owner. If the owner has 
                nothing to do with the broken windows, doors or opened doors after a certain time then the 
                owner will forward the report to the police or security company. Then it will lock every entrance 
                with burglars so that the thief will not have a way out and will be locked till the police or 
                security company arrives. The door and window sensor that reports via an app will also make 
                people's lives easier. It will not be easy as a thief to break through houses and cars.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>In terms of murders or people who get away with murders, I think it's time for this thing to stop. 
                You may ask yourself how, because police have been trying to do something about it, but still people 
                get away with murders. Police investigators should take a look at using IoT. For example, lack of data 
                may also be evidence.When a gadget goes offline, it frequently implies something. Was the protest impaired 
                on reason? Was it crushed or disengaged to redirect or camouflage something? Pay consideration to where the 
                information stops. Usually, moreover, a vital portion of the story.So police should follow the leads and tracks 
                to find out if everything is still right by tracking the last location where the gadget goes offline. Also, data 
                can be stored in more than one place. Fair since information has been deleted from a gadget, it isn't cruel, it 
                is gone until the end of time. In some cases information exists on the equipment itself, and now and then it is 
                put away on an inaccessible server, regularly alluded to as “the cloud.” Take cell phones, for cash. You'll be 
                able to wipe your cell phone clean of all photographs, content messages, apps, and call records, but in case 
                your phone is being sponsored up to the cloud, the information is still available. Also, your carrier will 
                still have the call records, your apps will be backed up, and anybody with whom you have spoken will have 
                records of your sent and received messages. Cell phones are a fair illustration. Most IoT gadgets nowadays 
                take off impressions in numerous places.
