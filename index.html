        <h1>The Internet of Things</h1>
        <p> We are evolving and becoming more advanced in terms of technology. Year by year we try to find an easy way to solve problems using technology. And I’m talking about IoT. You’re not alone if you’re confused. Most people neither want nor need to dive into the nitty-gritty of IoT. In this report, I’ll be providing a simple explanation of the Internet of Things, how it works, a most critical problem we are facing and solutions of managing the challenge/problem. We should say thank you with the arrival of super-cheap computer chips and the prevalence of wireless networks. Anything can become part of the Internet of Things, from storing our data or information in CDs, SD cards and USB to  iclouds, google drive, onedrive and many more. By connecting these different objects and adding sensors to them, we add a level of digital intelligence to devices that would otherwise be dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without human involvement. We are living in a smarter, more responsive world because of the Internet of Things, which merges the physical and digital worlds. Before we jump in, note that “The Internet of Things” and “IoT” can and will be used interchangeably.

                <h3>What is Internet of Things?</h3>
                <p>The Internet of Things is a system of interconnected devices and objects. They can
                    collect data without requiring human interaction. The concept of the internet of things
                    refers to the various devices and objects that can be connected to the Internet. Some of
                    these include a heart monitor, an automobile, and a farm animal. The Internet of Things
                    (IoT) is transforming how organizations operate and improve their customer service. Its
                    ability to connect to various devices and gather data is transforming how businesses
                    operate.</p>

                <h3>How does Internet of Things works?</h3>
                <p>An Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is a collection of devices that use embedded
                    systems to collect and transmit data from their environment. These devices typically
                    communicate with each other and with a cloud-based service to store and analyze the
                    data they collect. The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with
                    these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.IoT
                    can also make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to add help in
                    making data collecting processes easier and more dynamic.</p>

                <h3>Importances of Internet of Things</h3>
                <p>The Internet of Things is a revolution in how people live and work. It connects people
                    and machines to each other, letting them control and monitor their devices. This is also
                    beneficial for businesses as it allows them to collect data on various systems and
                    operations. Through the Internet of Things, companies can benefit from lower labor
                    costs, better service delivery, and lower waste. It also helps them avoid costly mistakes
                    and improve their efficiency. As such, the Internet of Things is becoming more prevalent
                    as more businesses realize how it can help them keep up with the latest trends and
                    improve their operations.</p>

        <h1>IDEAS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
        <p>Assuming that you all know about the Internet of Things now, what it is, how it works
            and why it is important in our lives. So let me jump to the point which I wanted to
            address. We as South Africans we are facing a crisis which is crime. I address my two ideas: </p>

                 <h3>Sensor</h3>
                 <p>  In terms of house robbers and cars, it's really hard to accept that you have lost 
                     something that you worked hard for years to get and it is taken from you easily. So 
                     the idea that I have in mind to stop this crisis is the sensor that can sense the doors
                     and windows when they get broken or are opened after a certain time, which will report to
                     the owner of the house or a car via an app which will notify the owner. If the owner has 
                     nothing to do with the broken windows, doors or opened doors after a certain time then the 
                     owner will forward the report to the police or security company. Then it will lock every entrance 
                     with burglars so that the thief will not have a way out and will be locked till the police or 
                     security company arrives. The door and window sensor that reports via an app will also make 
                     people's lives easier. It will not be easy as a thief to break through houses and cars.

                 <h3>Data</h3>
                 <p>In terms of murders or people who get away with murders, I think it's time for this thing to stop. 
                     You may ask yourself how, because police have been trying to do something about it, but still people 
                     get away with murders. Police investigators should take a look at using IoT. For example, lack of data 
                     may also be evidence.When a gadget goes offline, it frequently implies something. Was the protest impaired 
                     on reason? Was it crushed or disengaged to redirect or camouflage something? Pay consideration to where the 
                     information stops. Usually, moreover, a vital portion of the story.So police should follow the leads and tracks 
                     to find out if everything is still right by tracking the last location where the gadget goes offline. Also, data 
                     can be stored in more than one place. Fair since information has been deleted from a gadget, it isn't cruel, it 
                     is gone until the end of time. In some cases information exists on the equipment itself, and now and then it is 
                     put away on an inaccessible server, regularly alluded to as “the cloud.” Take cell phones, for cash. You'll be 
                     able to wipe your cell phone clean of all photographs, content messages, apps, and call records, but in case 
                     your phone is being sponsored up to the cloud, the information is still available. Also, your carrier will 
                     still have the call records, your apps will be backed up, and anybody with whom you have spoken will have 
                     records of your sent and received messages. Cell phones are a fair illustration. Most IoT gadgets nowadays 
                     take off impressions in numerous places.
